    <td valign="top"><p align="left" class="bodytext_BLACK"><strong>Following his father's footsteps, one of the
        greatest teachers of Shotokan Karate-Do primarily began to practice Judo
        when he was six years old and by the age of 16 he was 3Dan. At that time
        he saw Yoshitaka Funakoshi practicing Karate-Do in the Shotokan Dojo,
        which sealed his fate, making it crucial for him to chose Shotokan Karate-Do
        as his life choice. During W.W.II he was a trainee in the camp for kamikaze
        pilots. It was desitny's plan that he survived his kamikaze duty due
        to the fact that the day of his flight coincided with the capitulation
        of Japan.</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="bodytext_BLACK">After the war he was the first and the youngest
        holder of 3Dan, joining the JKA and wanting to fulfill his wish to be
        a fulltime karate instructor. In 1963, as one of the most qualified Chief
        Instructors of JKA he trained younger instructors (Shirai, Enoeda, Kanazawa)
        and led them to a world tour, on mission to spread Shotokan karate throughout
        the world. In 1965 he arrived in Europe and from 1967 until his death
        in 2004 he lived in Paris.</p>
      <p align="left" class="bodytext_BLACK">Though he was a member of JKA and one of the
        creators of the first competition rules, he never ceased to practice
        Karate as a Budo martial art. The modern development of Karate led to
        its separation from the Budo concept. His belief was that modern, sport
        development of Karate-Do, leads to its separation from Budo concept and
        that causes karate to loose its authentic soul.</p>
      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">He considered sport competition only one
          phase of development, due to the fact that competition is only a limited
          reality of Karate-Do. It is restricted by rules of competition and
          the referee's objectivity. In martial art's philosophy mind must be
          free with no limits. Therefore, there should be a level above the competiton
        and that is Budo Karate.<br>
        <br>
        His deep affection towards japnese samurai's tradition and principles
        of the Bushido code, marked his approach to Shotokan Karate-Do, finally
        resulting in a distinguished line of Shotokan karate style that bares
        his seal, the Kase Ha Shotokan Ryu Karate-Do.</p>
      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">In his approach to the different aspects
          of practice (physical, mental and spiritual) he had only one aim, and
          that was to go beyond the limits, in order to reach a level beyond
        the technique and physical power.</p>
      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">Following his teachers ideas and tirelessly
          searching for ways of elevating his own abilities, he achieved the
          level of total energy control. His legendary breathtaking demonstrations
          cannot be logicaly explained, they are more like methaphysical phenomenon
        questioning the ultimate human abilities.</p>
      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">On the other hand he had a precise and
          personal choice, to teach Karate-Do free of any sport-political conditionment.
          He manged to preserve this attitude and survived many changes in the
          world's karate policy, which has often poisoned the international karate
        environment.</p>
      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">Taiji Kase Sensei embodied love towards
          Karate-Do, to which he had devoted his life to. The integrity of his
          behaviour, the loyalty towards friends and students and his deep humanity,
          made Kase Sensei a precise reference point for those who love Karate-Do
          above any logos. A Karate-Do that comes to us directly from Gichin
          and most of all from Yoshitaka Funakoshi. Today it continues to live
        as the Kase Ha Shotokan Ryu Karate-Do.</p>
