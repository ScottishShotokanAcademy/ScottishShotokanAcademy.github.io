It was a            fascinating conversation for me, but unfortunately it only lasted            twenty minutes or so, and since that time I had always wanted to            meet him again, because Kase has pretty much seen it all &hellip; Gichin Funakoshi and his talented          son Yoshitaka, the old Shotokan dojo, the post war years and the competition          with other styles, the founding of the JKA &hellip; over 60 years of          experience with karate and budo. Well, it took a long time, and I thought          Kase Sensei's recent heart attack might have prevented it, but when          he gave a comeback course in Belgium in May 2000, I made arrangements          to meet him and the following is a summary of our conversation.</strong></p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">Taiji Kase was          born in 1929 and he started his martial arts training in judo at the          age of six. But, then, when a young Marine Cadet of fifteen he saw          Gichin Funakoshi's book Karate-do Kyohan and that generated an interest          in karate which has never left him. He went along to the Meijiro section          of Tokyo to enroll in Funakoshi's Shotokan dojo, and then, when he          saw Yoshitaka Funakoshi practising kicking techniques - and here Kase          gestured &quot;Maegeri-Mawashigeri-Yokogeri        - Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! - he was amazed, and even more determined to        learn such a strong fighting art.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">At that time          Gichin Funakoshi had retired from teaching and passed leadership of          the Shotokan to Yoshitaka, his third son: Yoshitaka, apparently, was          given a stamp, a seal, to recognise this authority. Master Gichin may          have given a little instruction now and then, however, because Kase          remembers one occasion when he was shown how to make a fist by the          old master. This was in the form shown in Gichin Funakoshi's first          books, but by then more or less obsolete, where the index finger is          not curled up in the fist, but stretched out so that it rests on the          palm at the base of the thumb. At the next training session Yoshitaka          noticed this and asked Kase &quot;who showed you how to make        a fist that way?&quot; Although a little hesitant the young Kase replied        that it had been his father. &quot;My father taught you that?&quot; said        Yoshitaka, before correcting Kase's fist and saying that that old method        was &quot;farmer's karate &hellip; but when he said all that it was in        a humorous, good natured way.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">Yoshitaka was the Chief Instructor of the        Shotokan but he was assisted by Seniors Genshin Hironishi (who had returned        from the Chinese battlefront a couple of years before), Yoshiaki Hayashi        (who was the model for Ten-no-kata in the 1943 Karate Nyumon), and Wado        Uemura. Shingeru Egami, another of the leading lights in Shotokan karate,        was back in Kyushu looking after the family business. Although this ran        into difficulties after the war, during the war years it was a significant        business employing a hundred people and Egami was a fairly rich man.        At any rate, this kept Egami back in Kyushu, although Kase thought that        he would come up to Tokyo now and then to train for short periods with        Yoshitaka.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">There is a well          known series of photographs of Egami and Yoshitaka taken in the late          1930's. I showed Kase Sensei some of these and he commented that they          were taken some time before he started at the Shotokan. When he knew          Yoshitaka he had put on a little more weight and had a noticeable stomach.          He wasn't big or muscular, but had a whole-body power, which made his        karate very powerful. Yoshitaka style, said Kase was a &quot;speed plus power&quot; karate.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">And yet, although          Yoshitaka appeared healthy and strong on the surface, he had suffered          from tuberculosis since he was a child. In fact, said Kase, &quot;Yoshitaka had been told at seven        years old that he would not live past twenty, and so when he reached        twenty, then twenty one&hellip; twenty two, he was surprised, and he        may have attributed his survival, or part of it, to his karate training.        Kase thought, however, that Yoshitaka may have had something of &quot;a        complex&quot; about all this, since he knew that at any moment he might        become seriously ill and die. Although Yoshitaka did teach at the Shotokan        in those later years, Genshin Hironishi told Kase that he would have        to sleep, or rest in bed all day, to conserve his strength for those        evening training sessions.<br />        Taiji Kase had heard some Yoshitaka stories. There was the famous Shito-ryu        instructor who supposedly had a &quot;special technique&quot; which would        always gain him victory. When he tried to apply this against Yoshitaka,        however, he was countered and thrown back several yards across the dojo.        Another well known teacher - it was Kanken Toyama, Kase said - was supposed        to have a secret &quot;tearing the flesh&quot; technique. Yoshitaka told        Toyama to try that technique on his thigh muscles. Toyama gripped Yoshitaka's        thigh but nothing happened. Yoshitaka told him to try harder &hellip; nothing.        Kase chuckled as told these stories.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">Was the training          at the Shotokan hard at that time? Yes, because this was the war and          the attitude to training was very serious. A lot of kumite was practised,          gohon and sambon kumite, and jyu-ippon, and every effort was made to          hit with the attack. There was a kind of sambon kumite done in a &quot;rushing&quot; style          where you tried to catch your partner. Were people hurt or injured          during practice? Oh yes. Sometimes university students would come to          the dojo and since they were often more experienced, very fast and        strong, you would be very apprehensive about facing them in kumite.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">Well in 1945          the Shotokan was destroyed in a bombing raid, then Japan surrendered,          and then Yoshitaka Funakoshi died, all within a few months. Karate          practice stopped for a time, but then it slowly began to pick up. As          early as 1947 in Life magazine there was a two page feature on karate          practice in Japan, and when I showed this to Kase Sensei he immediately          identified the two karate in the main photo as Hiroshi Kamata and Gojuru          Harada. Karate was fortunate, in fact, in escaping the American Forces          ban which affected judo and kendo at that time. Kase explained that          this was because the karate groups described their art as of &quot;Chinese origin&quot; rather        than Japanese, and the Americans left them alone.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">After the war          Taiji Kase enrolled at Senshu University where he continued his training          and became the captain of the karate team. The Sensei there was Genshin          Hironishi and his training was hard. Then Kase heard that Shigeru Egami          was teaching at Chuo University, so he went over to Chuo to train with          Egami too (&quot;very sharp technique&quot;).        In fact, the young Kase was passionate about karate, and when I showed        him a group photo taken in 1951 he pointed to someone in the front row        (I didn't quite get the name) and said that the well known Tadao Okuyama        used to lodge at his house. So Kase made contact with this person because        he really wanted to learn from the enigmatic Okuyama.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">There is a karate          story here which is almost forgotten. When we were talking about the          wartime Shotokan, Kase Sensei mentioned that Yoshitaka's group was          involved in teaching secret agents. &quot;The        Nakano School?&quot; I asked and Kase replied yes, and he stressed that        the authorities had gone to Yoshitaka and asked him to teach there. But,        he added, some of Yoshitaka's pupils advised him against direct involvement,        so it was Tadao Okuyama who was actually sent. Yoshitaka Funakoshi was        officially the instructor, and he may have gone there a few times, but        it was Okuyama who did most of the teaching. &quot;What did he teach?&quot; I        asked. &quot;Killing technique!&quot; Kase replied.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">Anyway, Kase          did study with Tadao Okuyama in that post war period and he told me          that Okuyama had &quot;very special        technique&quot;. When I asked him about that, he simply shook his head        and smiled. Okoyama was indeed special, and looking again at that old        photo, with all the various Shotokan seniors, Kase said that he thought,        of all that generation, Okuyama was &quot;the highest&quot;. At one time        he had gone away to the mountains to train, and then later he became        involved with the Omotokyo sect of Shintoism, the same sect of Shintoism        that influenced Morihei Uyeshiba, as a matter of fact. Okuyma became        the bodyguard of the head of Omotokyo and lived in the group's headquarters,        which made him somewhat difficult to contact.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">Yoshitaka Funakoshi's          idea was that karate should develop continuously, and Okuyama had taken          this idea to its full potential - &quot;Develop, develop, develop,&quot; said Kase. He didn't        believe in hundreds of mechanical repetitions, but was always searching        for the true technique, and Kase said that Okuyama had &quot;a special        kind of power, not from the muscles, not from kime, something else&quot;.        As an interesting aside to all this, Kase thought that Shigeru Egami        may have got some of his later ideas from Okuyama. &quot;Not copied&quot;,        he said, &quot;but got idea&quot;.<br />        In those post war years the different karate groups would sometimes get        together for joint training (kokan geiko) and often these sessions would        get very physical, especially when style rivalry was also involved. Kase        Sensei remembered the time in 1949 when the Shotokan Universities of        the East of Japan went down to Kyoto to meet the Universities of the        West - Ritsumeikan, Doshisha, Kansoi and so on; mainly Goju groups, with        maybe a couple of Shito-ryu. Kase recalls that, before the kumite sessions        began, the Shotokan seniors told the students that this was to be &quot;non-contact!&quot; -        but they wanted it clearly understood that when they said &quot;non-contact!&quot; they        really meant &quot;contact!&quot; Since the Goju seniors gave a similar        pep talk to their students, the kumite rapidly developed into something        of a bloodbath, with many of the participants being knocked down or unconscious,        or having their teeth punched out.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">A meeting was called on whether the kumite        should stop because of the injuries that were occurring, some people        did want to call a halt but Taiji Kase said that as long as they could        stand up they should continue. Anyway, it was agreed that the captains        should fight, and Kase faced the captain of Ritsumeikan, who he succeeded        in knocking down. Did he get injured himself? I asked. No, he was lucky,        though he just managed to evade the Ritsumeikan man's haito, which flew        past his head - Kase remembers it brushing through his hair.<br />        The Goju people were rough, Kase recalled, although the Shotokan style,        with its longer range yoko geri and mawashi geri attacks, worked well        against them. Goju was more a close quarters style and at that time the        Gojo karate didn't use those kicking techniques. It was only more or        less from that time that these techniques began to spread into Goju.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">Shotokan karate          wasn't highly organised at that time, but the various groups or fractions          - the university based groups of Keio, Hosei, Waseda, Taushoku, Chuo          and Senshu - all managed to work together. When Kase passed his third          dan grading in 1949 he did it before a panel composed of seniors from          all the universities, and he passed along with Jotaro Tagaki of Chuo          and Shimamura of Takushoku. Things seemed to be gong well enough, but          of course there were technical differences between the groups, and          also between those who had stayed in Japan during the 1930's and 1940's,          and those who had been away serving in China, Manchuria, and other          parts of the Japanese empire. Back in 1981, for example, Kase had told          me that when Masatoshi Nakayama came back to Japan after the war he          saw the younger students practising yoko geri, mawashi geri and so          on, and said &quot;That's not Shotokan karate!&quot;.        In Belgium, Kase Sensei confirmed that story, explaining that Nakayama        had said &quot;Not accept, not accept&quot;. Of course, by that time        those techniques were becoming well established, and not long after that        Nakayama himself was including these techniques in his demonstrations.<br />        In the 1950's the different Shotokan factions began to break away from        each other, and Taiji Kase joined the JKA as one of its senior members.        The way this happened &hellip; Kase had left university and was living        in a suburb of Tokyo, Hidetaka Nishiyama lived close by and would often        try and persuade Kase to come in with the JKA group. Kase was in two        minds about it, as he had come up with the Yoshitaka Funakoshi, Hironishi        group, and he told me in fact that many of Hironishi's students tried        to persuade him to have a permanent dojo where they could establish an        association to train in and teach karate. But that never happened, and        so Kase did join the JKA, and that gave him the life in karate that he        wanted.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">I remarked to          Kase Sensei that the JKA of that time, the Yotsuya dojo set up, was          predominantly run by Takushoku men, did that cause any difficulties          for him, coming from Senshu? No, he said, and that was due mainly to          Masatoshi Nakayama. Nakayama had a good heart and wanted everybody          to work together, so there wasn't a problem. Actually, Taiji Kase was          a very important member of the JKA. He was one of its directors, was          involved in formulating its first contest rules, and was a senior instructor,          which meant that he was responsible for teaching that first generation          of international instructors. Names like Hirokazu Kanazawa, Keinosuke          Enoeda and Hiroshi Shirai. Those three JKA champions in fact, made          a world tour in 1965 along with Kase, giving demonstrations wherever          they went. Terry O'Neill, ex-captain of the British Karate Team, saw          one of those early demonstrations and he told me that Kase was clearly          in charge, often telling one of the others to get up and work with          him, and occasionally knocking them about a little. &quot;So        they deferred to Kase as the senior?&quot; I asked Terry. &quot;Oh yes&quot;,        he replied. &quot;Definitely&quot;.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">The JKA began sending instructors abroad        around 1960, and Kase himself joined that exodus a few years later. He        taught in South Africa for a while, and then he settled with his wife        and daughters in France, which has been his base for the last thirty        years.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">It was Henry          Pl&eacute;e, the founder of        French karate, who brought him, and there was an element of chance to        it all. Pl&eacute;e had organised his summer course at St. Raphael and        had booked Hiroshi Shirai to teach. But Shirai couldn't make it and he        arranged for someone else to come instead, and when Pl&eacute;e saw that        it was Kase &hellip; well actually, he felt let down. Pl&eacute;e had        never met Kase but he had seen photos of him in Karate, a pocket book        in the old series Marabout Flash, and had not formed a good opinion of        his technique.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">But, he resigned          himself to the change of teacher and then, as the course got underway,          his view quickly began to change. Kase had a good rapport with the          students, and in terms of karate, &quot;une technique formidable&quot;. At the end of the course        it was agreed that Kase would come to teach at Henry Pl&eacute;e's famous        dojo in the 5th Arrondissement of Paris &hellip; and Pl&eacute;e wrote        an article for his Budo Magazine Europe entitled &quot;Dangers Sur Les        Interpretations Des Photos De Karate&quot;, (Dangers in judging karate        from photos).</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">In fact, Taiji          Kase was strict in teaching kihon and kata, but in kumite his technique          was much freer. The important thing here was timing, movement, and          applying power at the right moment. Tommy Morris, the well known Scottish          karateka, who trained at Pl&eacute;e's        dojo, told me that in kumite, Kase &quot;could really move&quot;. Unfortunately        there doesn't seem to be much footage of him from this time. I have a        short clip of him defending against two attackers in a demonstration        at a British Championships - he appears to throw them about easily -        and a performance of Meikyo kata in an IAKF Championships a few years        later. In contrast to the kata we see today, Kase's Meikyo isn't exaggerated        or theatrical; the technique is economical but strong, and the movement        is smooth, both across the mat and in the transition from one technique        to another; the kata of a mature karateka, you might say.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">I've corresponded          with Henry Pl&eacute;e        for years, and when I was in Paris a couple of years ago we talked about        the various Japanese Sensei he had brought over to teach at his dojo        in the 1950's and 1960's - Hiroo Machizuki, Tetsuji Murakami, Tsutomu        Ohshima, Mitsusuke Harada, Taiji Kase. Henry said that he would often        test the strength of these instructors by sparring with them soon after        they arrived. For instance he had hit Murakomi with a forefist punch,        leaving a lump the size of a small egg on his forehead. Had he done kumite        with Kase? Oh yes. Henry had many years of judo practice behind him and        so after a few moments he moved in and tried a judo throw. But Kase didn't        budge - &quot;He was like a rock&quot; - and then when Henry released        his hold and tried to move back he was hit by a Kase side kick which        double him up. &quot;Okay&quot;, he said to Kase, &quot;now I know who        is the strongest!&quot;</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">I asked Kase          Sensei about this and he chuckled. Yes, that had happened. Pl&eacute;e had done judo, but then he was an        experienced judoka too, and &quot;Japanese judo level very high&quot;.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">Pl&eacute;e told the French magazine Bushido: &quot;Kase        Sensei is only a small man but one who has mastered the sense of combat.        His exceptional worth lies in his practice of two forms of karate. One        based on combat, and the other on practice of the fundamentals. Another        advantage that he possesses is a simple strategy: he adapts to his opponent.        He sees that opening, and helped by his sense of timing, he moves in.        What underpins his strength is his experience of real combat. Here is        an example, several times I witnessed the special training sessions between        him, Shirai and Enoeda, during which they worked on fighting. If the        reach and speed of the other two enabled them to extend him, then immediately        Kase Sensei would step up a gear. They would back off. These workouts,        believe me, were something! They helped me understand what is combat        in karate, and real combat, even if the rules are still respected. Morevover,        it seems to me that his judo experience helps him. He has learned well        the way bodyweight moves. He knows when the opponent can or cannot attack,        that is to say, when the opponent is in the process of transferring his        bodyweight then he cannot attack. That is the moment when Kase Sensei        launches his famous deep attack. I think that judo is present in his        method of fighting. I remember when he arrived in France, the French        karatekas were influenced by Shukokai style, with a fighting posture        where the weight was very much on the forward leg, and of course, it        amused him to throw these unfortunates. But don't try to do the same        with him. He can't be uprooted. Occasionally I would work out with the        different experts who I brought to my dojo. Having some experience of        judo, I sometimes surprised them and occasionally threw them. But I never        succeeded in doing that with him. He's like concrete. For me, he is the        best fighter I have met. He love's fighting and never refuses a match.        Here's another story. I do not know if French karateka remember Baroux.        [Note: Patrick Baroux was European karate champion in the 1960's.] I        was fond of him and I was very moved by his death. Moreover, he was a        great champion. He used to train with me. One day, returning from the        European Championships, where he had won the title, he said to me. &quot;You        know, I think I can beat Kase Sensei. I'd like to try.&quot; I told Kase,        who said to me quite simply. &quot;No problem, whenever he wants.&quot; The        session took place in the dojo, near to the entrance. He let Baroux do        two or three techniques, then he stepped up the pace. He made a meal        of him, as it were. Later, Baroux told me &quot;I would never have believed        it. What a man!&quot;<br />        After his contract with Henri Pl&eacute;e finished, Kase set up on his        own, and gave courses throughout Europe. He was still with the JKA and        remained with them till the political problems of the 1980's, when he        left to set up his own organisation. As Henry Pl&eacute;e said, Taiji        Kase was never a politician or an intrigue. He just wanted to do karate,        and the break allowed him to do that in the way he wanted.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">Kase has not had a permanent dojo for years,        preferring to travel around Europe (or wherever) giving courses, mainly        to black belts. Even at seventy years old he was still doing that most        weekends until he suffered a heart attack last year. Of course, that        was a bad set back, but then after nine months or so, he gave a comeback        course in Paris in February, which was attended by 200 black belts. A        couple of months later came the Hasselt course, where we met.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">I first saw          Kase Sensei teaching in London in 1981, on a course for the Karate          Union of Great Britain. He was going through kata and it was interesting          to see the way he took the form apart and showed such things as how          to best position the body in relation to the opponent. In Hasselt the          class went through some prearranged kumite techniques and attacking          combinations, but mainly Kase concentrated on fundamentals - stance,          breathing, defence and blocking techniques. He started his first session          with practice on the opening movements of Sochin kata, working on kime          and rooting yourself to the ground, and he explained that in such a          position you should feel &quot;as if you weigh two hundred        kilograms&quot;. The class then went through a sequence of open handed        (shuto) movements, first done slowly with coordinated breathing - this        resembles Goju practice - and then quickly, with sharp kime. When he        worked on blocking techniques, Kase had the class first practice the        blocks with a full range movement and maximum power, but then the movement        had to be reduced, firstly to a half-range movement, and then to just        a few inches - while still retaining the power. In combat you wouldn't        have time to do a full range blocking technique, but even with short        range blocks you should be able to hurt the opponent's attacking limb,        or knock the opponent away with the force of the block. Kase told the        students that this was a &quot;speed plus power karate&quot;, and he        also explained that in kumite you should be able to go &quot;from zero        to one hundred percent&quot; in an instant.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">Kase stressed          to his followers that theirs was a &quot;Budo karate&quot;, and when I talked to him later I was impressed        at how he could talk with authority on the wide range of Japanese budo.        He spoke about kendo, about judo, and about such famous judomen as Kyuzo        Mifune and Masahiko Kimura, both of whom he had known personally; about        Morihei Uyeshiba and Aikido, (which he summarised as &quot;Daito-ryu        plus Shintoism&quot;); about such figures as Yukiyoshi Sagawa, the ninety-odd        year old expert in Daito-ryu who died a couple of years back and who        some thought was better than Uyeshiba, (&quot;some said second to Takeda&quot;,        Kase mentioned). When his senior student, Dirk Heene, mentioned a friend        who was trained in Hakko-ryu Ju-jutsu, Kase was able to explain the origins        of Hakko-ryu. Of course, he was fully aware of the other styles of Japanese        karate, and knew many of the leading figures in the Japanese karate world;        Mas Oyama, for example, who he had known way back in the post war years,        when they had briefly trained together in judo.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">While teaching, Kase Sensei was affable and        patient. Understandably, he didn't exert himself too much, but when he        did show a couple of techniques he was surprisingly sharp, especially        for a seventy one year old recovering from a heart attack. The classes        were for black belts only, with many of the participants having over        twenty or thirty years karate experience behind them. Some had switched        from other organisations, often after their competitive careers had ended        and they became aware of a lack of depth or direction in their training.        With Kase, some of them told me, they had found a fresh way forward.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">I don't practice          Shotokan karate, and I can't make any judgements on the various organisations          which teach it, but the Kase group seemed very loyal, and Taiji Kase's          influence benign. After all the training and gradings, and a long and          busy day for Kase Sensei, there was a meal, and this was where I was          able to talk to him for a couple of hours and ask all my questions.          He was straightforward and amiable, jovial even. When the meal was          finished Dirke Heene drove me, and Kase Sensei and his wife, back to          our hotels. Shortly before we reached my hotel Kase asked me about          the British karateka he had known from the 1960's &hellip; Bob Poynton,          Andy Sherry, Terry O'Neill, Frank Brennan. Were they still training?          Yes, I replied they were. That was good, he said. They were separated          now in different associations, but they were still all one Shotokan        family, and everybody should keep their karate strong.</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">We had arrived          at my hotel. And I can remember Kase Sensei's final words as I got          out of the car and said my goodbyes. &quot;Remember&quot;,        he said, &quot;If you see them - tell them to keep training!&quot;</p>      <p class="bodytext_BLACK">Graham Noble 2000</p>            <p align="left" class="bodytext_BLACK">&nbsp;</p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
